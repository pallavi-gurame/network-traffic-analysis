# network-traffic-analysis
Captured live network traffic using Wireshark. Identified and filtered protocols like TCP, DNS, and ICMP.

# Overview
This project demonstrates capturing and analyzing live network traffic using Wireshark.
The main goal is to observe network activity, identify commonly used protocols, and understand how they function in communication.

# Objectives
Select the correct network interface for packet capture.

Capture live network traffic while browsing and running test commands.

Apply filters to identify specific protocols such as TCP, DNS, and ICMP.

Save and document the results with screenshots.

# ðŸ›  Tools Used
Wireshark â€“ Packet capturing and analysis.

Windows Command Prompt â€“ Generating traffic using ping.

Web Browser â€“ Generating HTTP/DNS traffic.

# Steps Performed
Installed and opened Wireshark.

Selected the Wi-Fi network interface for capturing packets.

Started the capture while:

Browsing websites to generate HTTP/DNS traffic.

Running ping google.com to generate ICMP traffic.

# Applied filters:

tcp â€“ Shows TCP protocol packets.

dns â€“ Shows DNS query and response packets.

icmp â€“ Shows ICMP echo requests and replies.

Saved capture results and took screenshots for documentation.

# Screenshots
1. TCP Packets

2. DNS Packets

3. ICMP Packets

# Findings
TCP â€“ A reliable, connection-oriented protocol used for data transfer.

DNS â€“ Resolves domain names into IP addresses.

ICMP â€“ Used for diagnostic purposes such as ping requests and replies.
